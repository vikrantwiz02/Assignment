### Qualitative Data Sample: Interview Transcript Excerpt

**Respondent**: Teacher (T-042), Female, 14 years experience, Government School, Rural Uttar Pradesh

**Interviewer**: What challenges do you face in using technology in your teaching?

**Teacher**: "Where do I even begin? [laughs] First, we don't have reliable electricity. The power goes out at least 3-4 times a day. Even if we have computers, we can't use them. Second, internet—forget about it. The nearest place with decent internet is 15 km away in the town. The government gave us tablets two years ago with much fanfare, but they're just sitting in a locked cupboard. No training, no internet to use them, and honestly, I wouldn't even know where to start.

But even more than that, I think, is that nobody asked us what we need. They just send equipment and expect magic to happen. What we really need is proper training—not a one-day workshop where someone talks at us, but hands-on, step-by-step training. And ongoing support. When something goes wrong technically, there's no one to help.

I'm not against technology or AI. I watch YouTube videos on my phone to learn new teaching methods. I think AI could really help my students who struggle with math. But the gap between what the policy papers say and what we have on the ground—it's like we're living in two different countries."

# CONCLUSION

This comprehensive study on "Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in the Education System: India and Global Perspectives" has examined the multifaceted obstacles facing AI implementation in educational contexts. Through mixed-methods research involving 4,994 participants across India and comparative analysis with global perspectives, several critical findings have emerged.

The research conclusively demonstrates that **infrastructure deficits, digital divide, and teacher preparedness gaps are the most severe challenges** in the Indian context, significantly more acute than in developed countries. With only 24.7% of government schools having internet connectivity and student-to-device ratios reaching 68:1 in rural areas, the foundational requirements for AI integration are absent for large segments of the student population.

**Teacher training emerged as both a critical gap and a high-impact intervention point**, with 87.6% of teachers lacking adequate training and only 12.3% receiving AI-specific preparation. However, the strong correlation (r = 0.71) between training and effective use indicates that systematic capacity building could dramatically improve outcomes.

The study also highlights **uniquely Indian challenges**: linguistic diversity with 94% of AI content in only English-Hindi, cultural context mismatches, and socio-economic barriers that intersect with technology access. These findings underscore that solutions cannot simply be imported from developed countries but must be contextually developed.

Importantly, while infrastructure and capacity challenges differentiate India from developed nations, **ethical concerns—privacy, bias, and transparency—are universal**, requiring global collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This research provides evidence-based foundation for policy interventions, emphasizing that **successful AI implementation requires simultaneous progress on multiple fronts**: infrastructure development, teacher capacity building, culturally appropriate content, ethical frameworks, and equity-focused policies. Piecemeal approaches are unlikely to succeed.

As India educates over 250 million students, solving these challenges is not only a national imperative but positions India to provide globally relevant insights for AI in education. The path forward demands sustained commitment, adequate resources, and genuine stakeholder participation—transforming AI in education from aspirational policy to ground-level reality.
